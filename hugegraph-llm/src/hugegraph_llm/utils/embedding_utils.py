    This function processes text embeddings asynchronously in parallel, using batching and semaphore
    to control concurrency, improving processing efficiency while preventing resource overuse.

    Args:
        embedding (BaseEmbedding): The embedding model instance used to compute text embeddings.
        vids (list[str]): List of texts to compute embeddings for.

    Returns:
        list[Any]: List of embedding vectors corresponding to the input texts, maintaining the same
                  order as the input vids list.

    Note:
        - Note: Uses a semaphore to limit maximum concurrency if we need
        - Processes texts in batches of 500
        - Displays progress using a progress bar that updates as each batch completes
        - Uses asyncio.gather() to preserve order correspondence between input and output
