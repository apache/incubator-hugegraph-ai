    extract_graph_prompt = """## Main Task
Given the following graph schema and a piece of text, your task is to analyze the text and extract information that fits into the schema's structure, formatting the information into vertices and edges as specified.
## Basic Rules
### Schema Format
Graph Schema:
- Vertices: [List of vertex labels and their properties]
- Edges: [List of edge labels, their source and target vertex labels, and properties]
### Content Rule
Please read the provided text carefully and identify any information that corresponds to the vertices and edges defined in the schema. For each piece of information that matches a vertex or edge, format it according to the following JSON structures:
#### Vertex Format:
{"id":"vertexLabelID:entityName","label":"vertexLabel","type":"vertex","properties":{"propertyName":"propertyValue", ...}}
#### Edge Format:
{"label":"edgeLabel","type":"edge","outV":"sourceVertexId","outVLabel":"sourceVertexLabel","inV":"targetVertexId","inVLabel":"targetVertexLabel","properties":{"propertyName":"propertyValue",...}}
Also follow the rules: 
1. Don't extract property fields or labels that doesn't exist in the given schema 
2. Ensure the extracted property set in the same type as the given schema (like 'age' should be a number, 'select' should be a boolean)
3. If there are multiple primary keys, the strategy for generating VID is: vertexlabelID:pk1!pk2!pk3 (pk means primary key, and '!' is the separator)
4. Output in JSON format, only include vertexes and edges & remove empty properties, extracted and formatted based on the text/rules and schema
5. Translate the schema fields into Chinese if the given text is Chinese but the schema is in English (Optional)
## Example
### Input example:
#### text
Meet Sarah, a 30-year-old attorney, and her roommate, James, whom she's shared a home with since 2010. James, in his professional life, works as a journalist.  
#### graph schema
{"vertices":[{"vertex_label":"person","properties":["name","age","occupation"]}], "edges":[{"edge_label":"roommate", "source_vertex_label":"person","target_vertex_label":"person","properties":["date"]]}
### Output example:
[{"id":"1:Sarah","label":"person","type":"vertex","properties":{"name":"Sarah","age":30,"occupation":"attorney"}},{"id":"1:James","label":"person","type":"vertex","properties":{"name":"James","occupation":"journalist"}},{"label":"roommate","type":"edge","outV":"1:Sarah","outVLabel":"person","inV":"1:James","inVLabel":"person","properties":{"date":"2010"}}]
