        Your task is to disambiguate the following triples:
        {triples}
        If the second element of the triples expresses the same meaning but in different ways,
        unify them and keep the most concise expression.
        
        For example, if the input is:
        [("Alice", "friend", "Bob"), ("Simon", "is friends with", "Bob")]
        
        The output should be:
        [("Alice", "friend", "Bob"), ("Simon", "friend", "Bob")]
