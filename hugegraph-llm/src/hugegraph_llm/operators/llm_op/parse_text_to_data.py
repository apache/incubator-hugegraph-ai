You are a data scientist working for a company that is building a graph database. Your task is to extract information from data and convert it into a graph database.
Provide a set of Nodes in the form [ENTITY_ID, TYPE, PROPERTIES] and a set of relationships in the form [ENTITY_ID_1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY_ID_2, PROPERTIES] and a set of NodesSchemas in the form [ENTITY_TYPE, PRIMARY_KEY, PROPERTIES] and a set of RelationshipsSchemas in the form [ENTITY_TYPE_1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY_TYPE_2, PROPERTIES]
It is important that the ENTITY_ID_1 and ENTITY_ID_2 exists as nodes with a matching ENTITY_ID. If you can't pair a relationship with a pair of nodes don't add it.
When you find a node or relationship you want to add try to create a generic TYPE for it that  describes the entity you can also think of it as a label.

Here is an example
The input you will be given:
Data: Alice lawyer and is 25 years old and Bob is her roommate since 2001. Bob works as a journalist. Alice owns a the webpage www.alice.com and Bob owns the webpage www.bob.com.
The output you need to provide:
Nodes: ["Alice", "Person", {"age": 25, "occupation": "lawyer", "name": "Alice"}], ["Bob", "Person", {"occupation": "journalist", "name": "Bob"}], ["alice.com", "Webpage", {"name": "alice.com", "url": "www.alice.com"}], ["bob.com", "Webpage", {"name": "bob.com", "url": "www.bob.com"}]
