class ServicesManager(HugeParamsBase):
    """
    Manages services within HugeGraph via HTTP endpoints.

    This class acts as an interface to manage different types of services such as online
    transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP)
    in HugeGraph. It currently supports dynamic creation and management of services,
    with a focus on OLTP services for now.

    Methods:
        create_service(graphspace: str, service_create_parameters: ServiceCreateParameters):
            Creates a new service within a specified graph space using the provided parameters.
            Returns a dictionary with the details of the created service.

        list_services(graphspace: str):
            Lists all services available within a specified graph space.
            Returns a dictionary containing a list of service names.

        get_service(graphspace: str, service: str):
            Retrieve detailed information about a specific service within a graph space.
            Returns a dictionary with the service details.

        delete_service(graphspace: str, service: str):
            Delete a specific service within a graph space after confirmation.
            No return value expected; the operation's success is indicated by an HTTP 204 status code.
