class EarlyStopping:

    Early stopping utility to stop the training process if validation loss or accuracy doesn't
    improve after a given patience. Also saves the best model observed during training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patience : int
        How long to wait after last time the monitored quantity improved.
        Default is 5.
    min_delta : float
        Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement.
        Default is 0.0.
    monitor : str
        The metric to monitor for early stopping. Can be 'loss' or 'accuracy'.
        Default is 'loss'.
